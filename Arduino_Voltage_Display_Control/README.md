# Arduino Voltage Display & Control

This program was made as part of an interdisciplinary group project. Our goal was to make a fully functional Helmholtz coil that could create controlled magnetic fields on the XY, XZ, and YZ axes, and my task was to create the Arduino program that interfaced with a circuit and controlled the voltage(s) being fed into the coil. Our primary goal for the program was to prevent multiple voltages from being fed into the coil at the same time, since that would result in multiple magnetic fields being generated at the same time and interacting with each other. Inside the program, this is controlled just through simple if-statements, but it is important to highlight that this was a necessary safety feature for the project as a whole. The program dictates which voltage is fed into the coil by only allowing the highest voltage to pass through as input. It also displays this active voltage on LCD displays. See comments within Arduino program for further details.
